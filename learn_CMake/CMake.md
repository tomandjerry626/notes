## Running CMake

***\*Standard options\****

These are common CMake options to most packages:



==-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=== Pick from Release, RelWithDebInfo, Debug, or sometimes more.

==-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=== The location to install to. System install on UNIX would often be /usr/local (the default), user directories are often ~/.local, or you can pick a folder.

==-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=== You can set this ON or OFF to control the default for shared libraries (the author can pick one vs. the other explicitly instead of using the default, though)

==-DBUILD_TESTING=== This is a common name for enabling tests, not all packages use it, though, sometimes with good reason.
